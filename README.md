## Setup
NOTE: These installation instructions are not complete. They are a work in progress.<br>
(requires windows 10)

1. Make sure the above requirement is met - this (probably) only works on windows 10.
2. Move the taskbar to the top of the screen
3. Enable "Use small taskbar buttons" in windows settings
4. OPTIONAL: Setup [taskbarx](https://github.com/ChrisAnd1998/TaskbarX) to center the taskbar icons. This isn't a requirement, but it makes windows' animations fit in better with this project.
5. Install the [Fira code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font family
6. Download the zip file from (TODO: Put dl link here)
7. (I haven't written this step yet)
