## Setup
NOTE: These installation instructions are not complete. They are a work in progress.<br>
(requires windows 10 and python 3)

1. Make sure the above requirements are met. As above, this (probably) only works on windows 10. Python can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.4/python-3.11.4-amd64.exe)
2. Move the taskbar to the top of the screen
3. Enable "Use small taskbar buttons" in windows settings
4. OPTIONAL: Setup [taskbarx](https://github.com/ChrisAnd1998/TaskbarX) to center the taskbar icons. This isn't a requirement, but it makes window's animations fit in better with this project.
5. (I haven't written this step yet
